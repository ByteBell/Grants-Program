# Bytebell - Developer Copilot for Polkadot Ecosystem

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Tagline:** Unified context for the entire Polkadot stack—code, governance, and community, with receipts.

Bytebell is a developer copilot that prevents technical knowledge from scattering across your organization. We're building Polkadot ecosystem support so developers can query across substrate codebases, parachain documentation, governance discussions, and technical specifications—all in one place, with every answer tied to exact file, line, branch, and release.

Right now, Polkadot developers waste hours digging through substrate repos, parachain docs, and forum threads trying to piece together how things actually work. A runtime upgrade discussion lives in a governance post. The actual implementation is spread across three repos. Best practices exist only in someone's head or a Discord thread from six months ago. New parachain teams spend weeks just trying to understand the context they need.

We're interested in this because we've felt this pain building in the Web3 space. I spent years at Polygon and Biconomy dealing with fragmented infrastructure knowledge. Every new engineer took months to get productive because context was everywhere and nowhere. We built Bytebell to solve this—and Polkadot's technical depth makes it the perfect ecosystem to prove the value of unified, verifiable context.

### Project Details

**What we're building:**

A Polkadot-native deployment of Bytebell that ingests:
- Substrate core repos and pallets
- Parachain codebases (Moonbeam, Astar, Acala, etc.)
- Polkadot Forum discussions and governance proposals
- Technical RFCs and specification documents
- Key ecosystem documentation sites

**Core features:**
- Version-aware context graph linking code to discussions to specs
- Multi-agent retrieval that searches across all sources in parallel
- Receipt-based answers (file path, line number, commit hash, discussion link)
- Permission-aware access (respects private repos for teams)
- Works via web interface, MCP client, and coming soon - IDE plugins

**Technology stack:**
- VoltAgent framework (our multi-agent orchestration system)
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Graph database for relationship mapping
- SLMs and LLMs
- Permission inheritance from GitHub/GitLab

**What we already have:**
- Working product serving other ecosystems (ZK, Ethereum, SEI)
- 5 paying customers at $1200/month
- Proven ingestion pipeline for code, docs, PDFs, and discussions
- Multi-agent architecture that reduces hallucinations to near zero

**What we're NOT building:**
- A blockchain indexer (we query existing infrastructure)
- A code review tool or CI/CD system
- A general chatbot (we only answer with verified sources)
- Token-gated features or tokenomics

**Prior work:**
- Live deployment: https://zk.bytebell.ai (try it with ZK rollup questions)
- GitHub: https://github.com/ByteBell

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where we fit:**
Bytebell sits between developers and the fragmented Polkadot knowledge base. We're infrastructure for knowledge access—making the entire ecosystem's technical context queryable and verifiable.

**Target audience:**
- Parachain development teams building on Substrate
- New developers onboarding to Polkadot
- DevRel teams at parachains and ecosystem projects
- Core protocol contributors navigating complex codebases
- Governance participants researching technical proposals

**Needs we meet:**
1. **Faster onboarding** - New devs can ask questions and get cited answers instead of spending weeks reading docs
2. **Cross-repo context** - Understanding how pallets interact across different parachains
3. **Governance clarity** - Linking proposals to actual implementation and discussion history
4. **Reduced knowledge silos** - When experienced devs leave, their knowledge stays accessible
5. **Better technical decisions** - Complete context from code, specs, and community discussions

**Evidence of need:**
We've spoken to 30+ teams in Web3. The pattern is consistent:
- Web3 learning curve is notoriously steep (forum discussions full of "where do I even start")
- Onboarding developers repeatedly ask the same questions across multiple channels
- Every parachain maintains its own partial documentation, none comprehensive
- Senior devs spend 15-20% of time answering repeated questions
- Onboarding new engineers takes 3-6 months before first meaningful PR

Specific data points:
- Polkadot Forum has thousands of discussions with valuable context scattered across threads
- Substrate documentation site gets 50K+ visits monthly but conversion to actual developers is low
- Multiple teams have told us "if we could search all our context at once, we'd save days per sprint"

**Similar projects in ecosystem:**
Not really. There are general AI coding assistants (Cursor, GitHub Copilot) but they:
- Work on single repos, not cross-ecosystem context
- Don't understand Substrate-specific patterns
- Hallucinate frequently because they lack version awareness
- Can't connect governance discussions to actual code

Polkadot has great documentation sites (docs.substrate.io, wiki.polkadot.network) but they're:
- Static and hard to search across
- Disconnected from actual code implementations
- Don't capture community knowledge from forums/discussions
- No way to filter by runtime version or specific parachain

**Similar projects in other ecosystems:**
We're aware of some documentation aggregators and AI coding tools, but none combine:
- Version-aware knowledge graphs
- Receipt-based verification (refuse to answer without proof)
- Cross-source context (code + docs + discussions)
- On-chain state awareness
- Permission governance

The closest might be Mintlify or Gitbook for docs, but they don't handle code repositories or community discussions, and they don't provide the graph structure that makes context compound over time.

---

## Future Plans

**Short term (3-6 months post-grant):**
- Gather feedback and iterate on Substrate-specific features
- Ship IDE plugins (VS Code, IntelliJ) with Polkadot-aware features
- Present at Sub0 or Polkadot Decoded to drive adoption

**Long-term maintenance:**

We're building Bytebell as a sustainable SaaS business. During the 12-month grant period, the Polkadot deployment will be completely free for the entire ecosystem. During this period, all parachain teams, individual developers, core contributors, and community members will have unrestricted access to the full feature set—including private repo integration, analytics, and priority support—at no cost.
After the initial grant-funded year, we'll transition to a sustainable model:

Free tier: Public repos and ecosystem docs (always free for individual developers)
Team tier ($1200/month): Private repos, team analytics, priority support for commercial parachain teams
Enterprise: Custom deployments, SSO, SLAs for larger organizations

However, we're committed to keeping the core Polkadot ecosystem deployment accessible. Educational institutions, open-source projects, and individual developers will continue to have free access beyond the first year.

**Growth strategy**:

Start with parachain DevRel teams (they feel this pain most)
Expand to core protocol contributors
Partner with Polkadot educational programs (Polkadot Blockchain Academy, etc.)
Build corpus of "best practices" that compound as more teams use it
Open source the Substrate parser and some core components to drive adoption

**Free Access Period (Months 1-12)**
During the 12-month grant period, the Polkadot deployment will be completely free for the entire ecosystem. This includes:

- All parachain teams (commercial and non-commercial)
- Individual developers
- Core protocol contributors
- Community members
- Educational institutions
- General Public

Full feature access at no cost:

- Private repository integration
- Analytics dashboard
- Priority support
- All Substrate-specific features
- Unlimited queries

**Transition to Sustainable Model (Month 13 onwards)**
**Starting Month 13 (after grant completion)**, we'll introduce a tiered pricing model:
**Free Tier (Always Free)**:

- Public repositories and ecosystem documentation
- Community forum integration
- Basic analytics
- For: Individual developers, students, open-source projects
- Total 10 million tokens per month

**Team Tier ($1,500/month)**:

- Private repository integration
- Team analytics and insights
- Priority support
- Advanced features
- For: Commercial parachain teams and startups
- Total 200 million tokens per month


**Team's long-term vision:**
We believe every ecosystem needs a unified context layer. Polkadot is perfect because of its technical depth and the challenge of understanding how everything connects. If we nail this, we prove the model works for any complex technical ecosystem. Long term, we want Bytebell to be infrastructure—the layer that makes organizational knowledge queryable, verifiable, and useful for both humans and AI agents.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**
Through the Polkadot ecosystem. I've been following Substrate development for years and have seen grant announcements on the forum.

**Additional context:**

We've already invested 8 months building Bytebell and have paying customers. This grant isn't about proving the concept—it's about making Bytebell work specifically for Polkadot's unique needs. The Substrate-specific features we're building (pallet awareness, runtime version tracking, on-chain context) wouldn't make sense for our Ethereum or ZK customers, but they're critical for Polkadot.

We're also committed to giving back to the ecosystem. Parts of our Substrate parser and the MCP server will be open sourced so other tools can build on them.

**Why we're a good bet:**
- We've already shipped a working product (not vaporware)
- We have paying customers proving people want this
- We've built in Web3 infrastructure before (Polygon, Biconomy)
- We're realistic about timelines and scope
- We know how to take brittle systems to production scale

**What we need:**
Funding to focus on Polkadot integration for 3 months. We'll continue maintaining our existing customer deployments, but this grant lets us dedicate engineering time to ecosystem-specific features that benefit everyone.
